    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>10MinuteTastes was born out of a real struggle that many students and young adults face—trying to find time to cook while juggling school, work, and life. As a student at BYU–Hawaii, I realized that I, along with many of my friends, often skipped meals just because we were too busy or tired to cook.</p>

    <p>This website was created to help people like us—students, busy professionals, and anyone just starting to cook—to find quick, affordable, and simple recipes that can be made in 10 minutes or less.</p>

    <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Step-by-step recipes with simple ingredients</li>
      <li>Fun cooking tips and food facts</li>
      <li>Inspiration for easy and fast meals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We hope 10MinuteTastes helps you feel more confident and creative in the kitchen, no matter how busy life gets.</p>
