            <strong>Once upon a time, there was a little ferry named Finley.  </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <em> Finley was not the fastest boat, but he had a special gift—he could always be counted on. </em>
        </p>  

        <p>
            Every day, he helped the animals of the village cross the river to school, work, and the marketplace. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark> Finley loved being steady and reliable.  </mark>
        </p>  

        <p>
            One day, a big storm came, and all the other boats were too scared to sail. However, Finley said <q> I am not afraid. </q>
        </p> 

        <p>
            <b> He bravely carried everyone safely across the river. </b>
        </p>
