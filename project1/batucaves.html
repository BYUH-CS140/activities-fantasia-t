    <h2>Batu Caves</h2>

    <p>Batu Caves is one of Malaysia's most famous attractions, located just outside of Kuala Lumpur. It is a limestone hill that has a series of caves and temples inside, with a giant golden statue of Lord Murugan standing at the entrance. The site is a pilgrimage destination for Hindus, especially during the annual Thaipusam festival when thousands of devotees flock to the caves to offer prayers and perform rituals.</p>

    <p>The main cave, Temple Cave, is accessed by a staircase of 272 steps, offering a stunning view of the surrounding area. Inside the cave, you’ll find numerous Hindu shrines, colorful statues, and murals. Batu Caves is also home to several smaller caves, some of which feature natural formations, while others house exhibits related to Hinduism.</p>
